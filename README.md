# Useful Stuffs

This is a repo where I can store code snippets, scripts, github repos, or other utilities that I find helpful in my day to day life on linux.  If you would like to use any of these scripts or anything, feel free to, I just find them super helpful so that I can be more productive.

## Scripts
  - linstall <Provided by [lucemans](https://github.com/lucemans)>: This is a very basic script that allows you to search to apt repos to install something you want to install
  - dev <Provided by [lucemans](https://github.com/lucemans)>: This will allow you to search through your projects folder to open it in your terminal, it's a very simple script, but can be super helpful.


## How to source a bash script
This is just how to source bash scripts to be able to run them in your terminal

source ./linstall.bash
```
