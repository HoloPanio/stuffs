Bashrc is something that will allow you to run commands as soon as terminal opens up, this way you can have custom bash functions everytime you open your terminal. To do this, all you need to do is open .bashrc, which is in your home folder, and your editor of choosing and add the functions/scripts you want to run when you open terminal this will make it much easier to manage your scripts without having to call them everytime.
